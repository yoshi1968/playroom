Looking to get the first N elements from different elements of data
Attached is sample data to illustrate my issue with both sample data and solution.
I am looking to get the highest 
3 from "A group", 
3 from "B group", 
2 from "C group" 
(blue in solution) 

and then sthe top 
2 from any group that is left over 
(green in solution).

This needs to be identified (flagged) 
by year (2 groups of these top N amounts) and 
also by both quantity and amount separately.  
See solution tab for clarity.
Thanks in advance as I have been struggling with this for too long now.
